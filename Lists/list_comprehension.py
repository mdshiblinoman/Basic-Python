List Comprehension:
List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.
Example:
Based on a list of fruits, you want a new list, containing only the fruits with the letter "a" in the name.
Without list comprehension you will have to write a for statement with a conditional test inside:
'''
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = []

for x in fruits:
  if "a" in x:
    newlist.append(x)

print(newlist)

# With list comprehension you can do all that with only one line of code:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = [x for x in fruits if "a" in x]
print(newlist)

# newlist = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]
# The return value is a new list, leaving the old list unchanged.
# The condition is like a filter that only accepts the items that evaluate to True.
# Only accept items that are not "apple":
newlist = [x for x in fruits if x != "apple"]

# With no if statement:
newlist = [x for x in fruits]

# You can use the range() function to create an iterable:
newlist = [x for x in range(10)]

# Accept only numbers lower than 5:
newlist = [x for x in range(10) if x < 5]

# Set the values in the new list to upper case:
newlist = [x.upper() for x in fruits]

# Set all values in the new list to 'hello':
newlist = ['hello' for x in fruits]

# Return "orange" instead of "banana":
newlist = [x if x != "banana" else "orange" for x in fruits]
