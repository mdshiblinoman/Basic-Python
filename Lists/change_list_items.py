# To change the value of a specific item, refer to the index number:
# Change the second item:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist[1] = "blackcurrant"
print(thislist)

# To change the value of items within a specific range, define a list with the new values,
# and refer to the range of index numbers where you want to insert the new values:
# Change the values "banana" and "cherry" with the values "blackcurrant" and "watermelon":
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "mango"]
thislist[1:3] = ["blackcurrant", "watermelon"]
print(thislist)

# If you insert more items than you replace, the new items will be inserted where you specified, and the
# remaining items will move accordingly:
# Change the second value by replacing it with two new values:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist[1:2] = ["blackcurrant", "watermelon"]
print(thislist)

# Change the second and third value by replacing it with one value:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist[1:3] = ["watermelon"]
print(thislist)

# To insert a new list item, without replacing any of the existing values, we can use the insert() method.
# The insert() method inserts an item at the specified index:

# Insert "watermelon" as the third item:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.insert(2, "watermelon")
print(thislist)
