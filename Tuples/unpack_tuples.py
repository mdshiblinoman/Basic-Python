# When we create a tuple, we normally assign values to it. This is called "packing" a tuple:
# Packing a tuple:
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(fruits)

# But, in Python, we are also allowed to extract the values back into variables. This is called "unpacking":
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

(green, yellow, red) = fruits

print(green)
print(yellow)
print(red)

# If the number of variables is less than the number of values, you can add an * to the variable name and the values
# will be assigned to the variable as a list:
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "strawberry", "raspberry")

(green, yellow, *red) = fruits

print(green)
print(yellow)
print(red)

# If the asterisk is added to another variable name than the last, Python will assign values to the variable until
# the number of values left matches the number of variables left.
# Add a list of values the "tropic" variable:
fruits = ("apple", "mango", "papaya", "pineapple", "cherry")

(green, *tropic, red) = fruits

print(green)
print(tropic)
print(red)
