Precedence Order
The precedence order is described in the table below, starting with the highest precedence at the top:

Operator	                            Description	Try it
()	                                    Parentheses
**	                                    Exponentiation
+x  -x  ~x	                            Unary plus, unary minus, and bitwise NOT
*  /  //  %	                            Multiplication, division, floor division, and modulus
+  -	                                Addition and subtraction
<<  >>	                                Bitwise left and right shifts
&	                                    Bitwise AND
^	                                    Bitwise XOR

==  !=  >  >=  <  <=                    is  is not  in  not in 	Comparisons, identity, and membership operators
not	                                    Logical NOT
and	                                    AND
or	                                    OR

# Parentheses has the highest precedence, meaning that expressions inside parentheses must be evaluated first:
print((6 + 3) - (6 + 3))

# Multiplication * has higher precedence than addition +, and therefore multiplications are evaluated before additions:
print(100 + 5 * 3)

# Addition + and subtraction - has the same precedence, and therefore we evaluate the expression from left to right:
print(5 + 4 - 7 + 3)
