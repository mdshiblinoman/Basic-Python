Python range
The built-in range() function returns an immutable sequence of numbers, commonly used for looping a specific number of times.
This set of numbers has its own data type called range.
Creating ranges
The range() function can be called with 1, 2, or 3 arguments, using this syntax:
'''

'''
Call range() With One Argument
If the range function is called with only one argument, the argument represents the stop value.
The start argument is optional, and if not provided, it defaults to 0.
range(10) returns a sequence of each number from 0 to 9. (The start argument, 0 is inclusive, and the stop argument, 10 is exclusive).
'''
# Create a range of numbers from 0 to 9:
x = range(10)
print(x)

'''
Call range() With Two Arguments
If the range function is called with two arguments, the first argument represents the start value, and 
the second argument represents the stop value.
range(3, 10) returns a sequence of each number from 3 to 9:
'''
# Create a range of numbers from 3 to 9:
x = range(3, 10)

'''
Call range() With Three Arguments
If the range function is called with three arguments, the third argument represents the step value.
The step value means the difference between each number in the sequence. It is optional, and if not provided, it defaults to 1.
range(3, 10, 2) returns a sequence of each number from 3 to 9, with a step of 2:
'''
# Create a range of numbers from 3 to 9:
x = range(3, 10, 2)

# Ranges are often used in for loops to iterate over a sequence of numbers.
# Iterate over each value in a range:
for i in range(10):
  print(i)

'''
Using List to Display Ranges
The range object is a data type that represents an immutable sequence of numbers, and it is not directly displayable.
Therefore, ranges are often converted to lists for display.
'''
# Convert different ranges to lists:
print(list(range(5)))
print(list(range(1, 6)))
print(list(range(5, 20, 3)))

# Extract a subsequence from a range:
r = range(10)
print(r[2])
print(r[:3])

# Test if the numbers 6 and 7 are present in a range:
r = range(0, 10, 2)
print(6 in r)
print(7 in r)

# Get the length of a range:
r = range(0, 10, 2)
print(len(r))
