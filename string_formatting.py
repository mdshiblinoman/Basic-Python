'''
F-String was introduced in Python 3.6, and is now the preferred way of formatting strings.
Before Python 3.6 we had to use the format() method.
F-Strings
F-string allows you to format selected parts of a string.
To specify a string as an f-string, simply put an f in front of the string literal, like this:
'''
txt = f"The price is 49 dollars"
print(txt)

# To format values in an f-string, add placeholders {}, a placeholder can contain variables, operations, functions, and modifiers to format the value.
# Add a placeholder for the price variable:
price = 59
txt = f"The price is {price} dollars"
print(txt)

# A placeholder can also include a modifier to format the value.
# A modifier is included by adding a colon : followed by a legal formatting type, like .2f which means fixed point number with 2 decimals:
# Display the price with 2 decimals:
price = 59
txt = f"The price is {price:.2f} dollars"
print(txt)

# Display the value 95 with 2 decimals:
txt = f"The price is {95:.2f} dollars"
print(txt)

'''
Perform Operations in F-Strings
You can perform Python operations inside the placeholders.
You can do math operations:
Perform a math operation in the placeholder, and return the result:
'''
txt = f"The price is {20 * 59} dollars"
print(txt)

# Add taxes before displaying the price:
price = 59
tax = 0.25
txt = f"The price is {price + (price * tax)} dollars"
print(txt)

# Return "Expensive" if the price is over 50, otherwise return "Cheap":
price = 49
txt = f"It is very {'Expensive' if price>50 else 'Cheap'}"
print(txt)

# Use the string method upper()to convert a value into upper case letters:
fruit = "apples"
txt = f"I love {fruit.upper()}"
print(txt)

# Create a function that converts feet into meters:
def myconverter(x):
  return x * 0.3048

txt = f"The plane is flying at a {myconverter(30000)} meter altitude"
print(txt)

'''
At the beginning of this chapter we explained how to use the .2f modifier to format a number into a fixed point number with 2 decimals.
There are several other modifiers that can be used to format values:
Use a comma as a thousand separator:
'''
price = 59000
txt = f"The price is {price:,} dollars"
print(txt)

'''
String format()
Before Python 3.6 we used the format() method to format strings.
The format() method can still be used, but f-strings are faster and the preferred way to format strings.
The next examples in this page demonstrates how to format strings with the format() method.
The format() method also uses curly brackets as placeholders {}, but the syntax is slightly different:
'''
# Add a placeholder where you want to display the price:
price = 49
txt = "The price is {} dollars"
print(txt.format(price))

# Format the price to be displayed as a number with two decimals:
txt = "The price is {:.2f} dollars"

# If you want to use more values, just add more values to the format() method:
print(txt.format(price, itemno, count))

# And add more placeholders:
quantity = 3
itemno = 567
price = 49
myorder = "I want {} pieces of item number {} for {:.2f} dollars."
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))

# You can use index numbers (a number inside the curly brackets {0}) to be sure the values are placed in the correct placeholders:
quantity = 3
itemno = 567
price = 49
myorder = "I want {0} pieces of item number {1} for {2:.2f} dollars."
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))

# Also, if you want to refer to the same value more than once, use the index number:
age = 36
name = "John"
txt = "His name is {1}. {1} is {0} years old."
print(txt.format(age, name))

# You can also use named indexes by entering a name inside the curly brackets {carname}, but then you must use names when you pass the parameter
# values txt.format(carname = "Ford"):
myorder = "I have a {carname}, it is a {model}."
print(myorder.format(carname = "Ford", model = "Mustang"))
