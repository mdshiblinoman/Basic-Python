'''
The Elif Keyword:
The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".
The elif keyword allows you to check multiple expressions for True and execute a block
of code as soon as one of the conditions evaluates to True.
'''
a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")

# You can have as many elif statements as you need. Python will check each condition in order and execute the first one that is true.
score = 75
if score >= 90:
  print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80:
  print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 70:
  print("Grade: C")
elif score >= 60:
  print("Grade: D")

# When you use elif, Python evaluates the conditions from top to bottom.
# As soon as it finds a condition that is true, it executes that block and skips all remaining conditions.
age = 25
if age < 13:
  print("You are a child")
elif age < 20:
  print("You are a teenager")
elif age < 65:
  print("You are an adult")
elif age >= 65:
  print("You are a senior")

# Use elif when you have multiple mutually exclusive conditions to check. This is more efficient than using multiple separate
# if statements because Python stops checking once it finds a true condition.

if day == 1:
