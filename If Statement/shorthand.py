# Short Hand If
# If you have only one statement to execute, you can put it on the same line as the if statement
# One-line if statement:
a = 5
b = 2
if a > b: print("a is greater than b")

# Short Hand If ... Else
# If you have one statement for if and one for else, you can put them on the same line using a conditional expression:
a = 2
b = 330
print("A") if a > b else print("B")

# Assign a Value With If ... Else
# You can also use a one-line if/else to choose a value and assign it to a variable:
a = 10
b = 20
bigger = a if a > b else b
print("Bigger is", bigger)

'''
The syntax follows this pattern:
variable = value_if_true if condition else value_if_false
Multiple Conditions on One Line
You can chain conditional expressions, but keep it short so it stays readable:
'''
a = 330
b = 330
print("A") if a > b else print("=") if a == b else print("B")

# Finding the maximum of two numbers:
x = 15
y = 20
max_value = x if x > y else y
print("Maximum value:", max_value)

# Setting a default value:
username = ""
display_name = username if username else "Guest"
print("Welcome,", display_name)

'''
When to Use Shorthand If
Shorthand if statements and ternary operators should be used when:
The condition and actions are simple
It improves code readability
You want to make a quick assignment based on a condition
